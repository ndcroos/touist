(* Do you think this file is wierd, with this 'module rec' thing?
   This is because we want the type 'ast' to be used in 'Set' and
   also we want 'Set' to be inside an 'ast', I had to come up with
   this recursive (and quite confusing) module thing. I got
   the idea from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8552589
   Notes:
   (1) This is a trick that allows me to avoid repeating the type
       definitions in sig .. end and in struct .. end (explained
       in above link)
   (2) I don't know why but Set.elt wouldn't be Ast.ast... So
       I tried this and now it works...

      tranform UnexpProp into Prop before knowing what is the content of asthe
      variables. Examples:
          abcd(1,$d,$i,a)       <- not a full-string yet
      Prop contains the actual proposition after the evaluation has been run.
      Example: if $d=foo and $i=123, then Prop is:
          abcd(1,foo,123,a)     <- an actual string that represents an actual
                                    logical proposition

    | Loc              of ast * loc
    (* Loc is a clever way of keeping the locations in the text of asthe t elements.
      In parser.mly, each production rule gives its location in the original text;
      for example, instead of simply returning
          Inter (x,y)
      the parser will return
          Loc (Inter (x,y), ($startpos,$endpos))
      Loc is used in eval.ml when checking the types; it allows to give precise
      locations.
